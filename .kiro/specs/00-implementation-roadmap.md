3. **Track 3**: Tenant Management → Multi-city → Franchise Management

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Priority
```sql
-- Phase 1: Core tables
- tour_downloads, offline_content_cache
- driver_app_sessions, driver_availability, driver_performance_metrics
- tenants, tenant_branding, tenant_features

-- Phase 2: Feature tables
- interactive_content, user_interactions, user_achievements
- social_posts, social_interactions, user_connections
- user_preferences, recommendation_models

-- Phase 3: Advanced tables
- ar_content, ar_interactions
- training_modules, driver_training_progress
- franchises, franchise_roles, tenant_domains
```

### Service Layer Architecture

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
Following the steering rules for testing and quality:

#### Unit Testing (80%+ coverage target)
- **Offline sync logic**: Data consistency and conflict resolution
- **Route optimization algorithms**: Efficiency and accuracy
- **Recommendation engine**: Algorithm correctness
- **Tenant isolation**: Data security and separation
- **Financial calculations**: Earnings and revenue accuracy

#### Integration Testing
- **Cross-feature workflows**: Offline → Online sync
- **Multi-tenant data isolation**: Tenant boundary enforcement
- **Payment processing**: End-to-end financial flows
- **AR content loading**: Performance and reliability
- **Social sharing**: Privacy and permissions

#### Performance Testing
- **Offline storage limits**: Large dataset handling
- **AR rendering**: Frame rate and memory usage
- **Multi-tenant scalability**: Concurrent tenant load
- **Route optimization**: Response time under load
- **Database queries**: Query optimization and indexing

### Security Implementation
Following security steering rules:

#### Data Protection
- **Tenant data isolation**: Row-level security policies
- **Offline content encryption**: Local storage security
- **Financial data protection**: PCI compliance measures
- **Location data privacy**: GPS data anonymization
- **Social content moderation**: Content filtering and reporting

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-tenant access control**: Tenant-aware permissions
- **Driver mobile security**: Secure token management
- **Franchise hierarchy**: Role-based access control
- **API rate limiting**: Tenant-specific throttling
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
