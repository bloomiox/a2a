# Testing & Quality Assurance Steering

## Testing Standards

### Testing Guidelines
- Aim for high test coverage (80%+ for critical paths)
- Write tests that are independent and repeatable
- Follow the testing pyramid (unit > integration > e2e)
- Use meaningful test names that describe expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Implement both positive and negative test cases

## Quality Metrics

### Quality Benchmarks
- Maintain cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function
- Keep code duplication under 5%
- Ensure all critical paths have automated tests
- Monitor and improve code maintainability index
- Track and reduce technical debt regularly
- Implement continuous quality gates
